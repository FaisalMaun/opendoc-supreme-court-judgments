Building and Construction Law – Damages – Delay in completion

Building and Construction Law – Damages – Damages for defects

11 November 2019 - Judgment reserved.

### Chan Seng Onn J:

## Introduction

1       Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd (“the plaintiff”) is a company in the business of providing dental services, and it operates several dental clinics in Singapore. OP3 International Pte Ltd (“the defendant”) is a company that provides, _inter alia_, interior design and fitting-out works.[^1]

2       The present judgment follows _Smile Inc Dental Surgeons Pte Ltd v OP3 International Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2017\] SGHC 246</span> (the “Liability Judgment”), where I found that, flowing from various breaches by the defendant, the plaintiff’s clinic located at Suntec City Mall, 3 Temasek Boulevard #02-326/327, Singapore 038983 (“the Suntec Clinic” or “the new Suntec Clinic” (where appropriate))[^2] was subject to three periods of extended closure (collectively, “the Blackout Periods”) (Liability Judgment at \[158\]):

> (a)     From 12 September 2013 to 31 October 2013 (_ie_ 50 days), the Suntec Clinic was closed as a result of the delayed completion of fitting-out works (“the Works”) by the defendant;

> (b)     From 17 January 2014 to 8 March 2014 (_ie_ 51 days), the Suntec Clinic was closed as a consequence of flooding which had occurred due to the defendant’s failure to ensure that the Works were designed and executed in a manner that was fit for its intended purpose;

> (c)     From 29 July 2014 to 5 March 2015 (_ie_ 220 days), the Suntec Clinic was closed for a third time as a consequence of flooding which had occurred again due to the defendant’s failure to ensure that the Works were designed and executed in a manner that was fit for its intended purpose.

3       Accordingly, the defendant was liable for the losses in relation to the Blackout Periods lasting a total of **321** days. In this judgment, I will assess the extent of damages due from the defendant to the plaintiff due to its breaches.

## Background

4       The facts of the matter were extensively canvassed in the Liability Judgment, and I will therefore only state the key dates relevant for assessing the damages in this judgment:

> (a)     The plaintiff contracted for the defendant to complete the Works by 12 September 2013, before the grand opening of the refurbished Suntec City Mall;[^3]

> (b)     In breach of the agreement, the defendant only completed the Works on 31 October 2013, and the Suntec Clinic was only opened on 1 November 2013 as a result;[^4]

> (c)     On 9 January 2014, the plaintiff found mould growing on the walls of the filling room in the Suntec Clinic. On 17 January 2014, it was discovered that the mould was the result of a flood that had occurred in the Suntec Clinic (“the first flood”). As a result, the plaintiff closed the clinic on the same day, and handed it over to the defendant for remedial and rectification works.[^5]

> (d)     The defendant returned possession of the Suntec Clinic to the plaintiff on 8 March 2014.[^6]

> (e)     On 21 July 2014, the plaintiff again discovered mould growth on the same walls of the filing room in the Suntec Clinic. It was found that the growth was caused by flooding in the Suntec Clinic (“the second flood”). On 29 July 2014, the plaintiff closed the Suntec Clinic.[^7]

> (f)     Due to the plaintiff’s failure to pay outstanding rent and resume business at the Suntec Clinic, the landlord (the “landlord”) repossessed the Suntec Clinic on 30 March 2015.[^8]

## Burden of proof for each head of claim

5       The plaintiff’s heads of claim are aplenty, ranging from its expenses flowing from the removal and storage of the equipment and items in the Suntec Clinic, to expenses it had incurred to remedy the impact of the floods. Furthermore, the plaintiff claims for the loss of profit it suffered during the Blackout Periods, as well as wasted expenditure during the same periods.[^9] In total, the plaintiff claims in excess of $1,312,407.87.[^10]

6       Before proceeding to consider the validity of each head of claim, principles in relation to the burden of proof are apposite, as they relate to each head of claim that falls for my consideration.

7       It is trite law that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving each head of claim on the balance of probabilities. To meet this standard of proof, the plaintiff cannot merely assert that it has suffered a loss. Instead, each head of claim must necessarily be backed by evidence, whether documentary, oral or otherwise. Without any such evidence, the claim will not be established on the balance of probabilities, and the plaintiff’s claim will fail.

8       Where no evidence is furnished by the plaintiff to back its head of claim, there is strictly speaking _no_ burden on the defendant to raise any objection. As encapsulated by the Court of Appeal in _Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East, Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2007\] 4 SLR(R) 855</span> at \[60\]:

> …at the start of the plaintiff’s case, the legal burden of proving the existence of any relevant fact that the plaintiff must prove and the evidential burden of adducing some (not inherently incredible) evidence of the existence of such fact coincide. Upon adduction of that evidence, the evidential burden shifts to the defendant, as the case may be, to adduce some evidence in rebuttal. If no evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the court may conclude from the evidence of the plaintiff that the legal burden is also discharged and making a finding on the fact against the defendant. If, on the other hand, evidence in rebuttal is adduced, the evidential burden shifts back to the plaintiff. If, ultimately, the evidential burden comes to rest on the defendant, the legal burden of proof of that relevant fact would have been discharged by the plaintiff. The legal burden of proof – a permanent and enduring burden – does not shift. A party who has the legal burden of proof on any issue must discharge it throughout. Sometimes, the legal burden is spoken of, inaccurately, as “shifting”; but what is truly meant is that another issue has been engaged, on which the opposite party bears the legal burden of proof.

9       Relatedly, where evidence is furnished by a witness that goes to the very heart of the matter, whether through an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, in court, or otherwise, it will generally be accepted as the truth of the matter unless it is subject to a successful challenge in court. A belated challenge to such evidence in submissions where such a challenge was not put to the witness concerned may be disregarded. As Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) observed in _Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] SGHC 205</span> at \[42\]:

> …_Browne v Dunn_ is a case of some vintage and it lays down a rule of fairness. The effect of that rule is that _where a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission_. It is not a rigid, technical rule. Nor is it necessarily satisfied by a formulaic recitation of a party’s case to a witness, with an invitation merely to agree or disagree. In _Chan Emily v Kang Hock Chai Joachim_ <span class="citation">\[2005\] 2 SLR 236</span> at \[15\], Choo Han Teck J noted that the rule which is derived from a case more than a century old must be applied with due regard to the realities of modern litigation and in evaluating any given objection, consideration should be given to the totality of the evidence in the case. I think that is correct. In _Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina_ <span class="citation">\[2002\] 1 SLR 408</span> the Court of Appeal noted (at \[40\]) that _the rule is not rigid and does not require every point to be put to the witness but this would generally be required where the submission was “at the very heart of the matter”_… \[emphasis added\]

10     With the aforementioned principles in mind, I proceed to consider each head of claim submitted by the plaintiff.

## Categories of claim

11     The plaintiff claims for losses for four categories of damages that it allegedly suffered due to the defendant’s breaches, namely:

> (a)     First, the plaintiff claims for sums which it had been awarded in the Liability Judgment (“Category 1”). These sums are not disputed;[^11]

> (b)     Second, the plaintiff claims for losses that it incurred due to the defendant’s late completion of fitting-out (“Category 2”);[^12]

> (c)     Third, the plaintiff claims for losses due to the floods (“Category 3”), which are sub-divided as follows:

>> (i)       Category 3a consists of flood investigation and remediation costs in the aftermath of the second flood; and

>> (ii)       Category 3b consists of loss of management time and expense due to both floods.[^13]

> (d)     Fourth, the plaintiff claims for losses arising from the Blackout Periods and the permanent repossession of the Suntec Clinic by the landlord (“Category 4”), which losses are sub-divided as follows:

>> (i)       Category 4a consists of wasted operating costs,

>> (ii)       Category 4b consists of loss of profits,

>> (iii)       Category 4c consists of wasted capital expenses, and

>> (iv)       Category 4d consists of damages in connection with the early termination of the Suntec Clinic lease.[^14]

12     As the defendant’s submissions respond directly to the categories of damages as presented by the plaintiff, I will consider the plaintiff’s heads of claim generally in accordance with the four categories above.

13     However, I have decided to deal with the above Category 4 claims slightly differently by sorting them out into the following Categories to achieve more clarity and to simplify the understanding of the computation of the damages:

> (a)     Categories 4a _and_ 4b: Loss of revenue minus variable expenses that were saved during the Blackout Periods;

> (b)     Category 4c: Wasted capital expenses, comprising (i) wasted depreciation expenses from 6 March 2015 to the end date of the lease on 21 September 2016 and (ii) wasted rent in arrears paid to the landlord from 6 March 2015 to 29 March 2015, the day before the landlord’s termination of the lease; and

> (c)     Category 4d: Other damages in connection with the early termination of the lease and the repossession by the landlord on 30 March 2015.

## Category 1:   Sums awarded in the Liability Judgment

14     As mentioned, the sums in relation to Category 1 are not disputed. However, the plaintiff made some errors in computing sums that were awarded in the Liability Judgment. This needs to be corrected as follows:

## Category 2:   Losses incurred due to late completion of fitting-out

### Lack of evidence to show that delayed completion of fitting-out works was the cause of the plaintiff’s loss

15     Turning to Category 2, which relates to losses incurred by the plaintiff due to the delayed completion of fitting-out works by the defendant, the plaintiff claims for $17,886.60, being the advance payment of one month’s rent, service charge and promotion fund (collectively, “rent”) which it had paid to its landlord.

16     This one-month advance payment had been paid by the plaintiff to its landlord pursuant to a lease agreement between them (“the Lease”).[^15] In the Lease, the landlord also granted a two-month rent-free fitting-out period, provided that the plaintiff does not breach the Lease:[^16]

> The Landlord agrees to grant to the \[plaintiff\] a period of two (2) months … to carry out the Fitting-Out Works. Unless the Tenant is in breach of the Lease, the Tenant shall not be liable for any rent or other payment during the Fitting-Out Period…

This fitting-out period was from 22 July 2013 to 21 September 2013 (“Fitting-Out period”).[^17]

17     However, the plaintiff alleges that, due to the delayed completion by the defendant, the plaintiff became in breach of the Lease.[^18] As such, the landlord charged the plaintiff for the month of 1 August 2013 to 31 August 2013 by deducting the advance of one month’s rent paid by the plaintiff at the commencement of the Lease, which period would otherwise fall within the rent-free Fitting-Out period.[^19]

18     In this regard, Ms Chong Mo-Ai Grace (“Ms Chong”), the managing director of the plaintiff, asserted that the one-month advance on rent had been used to “knock off from the August period when \[the defendant\] was fitting-out \[the\] clinic”.[^20] However, Ms Chong could not provide any proof of correspondence from the landlord that the one-month advance payment had been used to charge the plaintiff for the rent for the month of August 2013 _because_ of the defendant’s delay in completing the Works. Instead, she admitted that she simply _presumed_ that the plaintiff had been charged the rent for the month of August 2013 _because_ of the defendant’s delay.[^21]

### Two effective causes of loss: the defendant’s breach which caused the second flood and the plaintiff’s failure to pay the rent timeously

19     In a Statement of Claim submitted by the landlord against the plaintiff on 18 May 2015, the landlord claimed, among others, for unpaid rent for the months of July and September 2013 (which also fell under the Fitting-Out period).[^22] Patently, given that rent was not claimed for August 2013 (which was within the Fitting-Out period), this supports Ms Chong’s claim that the one-month advance payment had been used to “knock off” the rent being charged by the landlord for the otherwise rent-free Fitting-Out month of August 2013 (_ie_ the first month of the two-month rent-free Fitting-Out period).

20     Nonetheless, the delayed completion was _not_ mentioned as a basis for the claim by the landlord against the plaintiff. Rather, the stipulated bases for the landlord’s claim was the plaintiff’s breach of the Lease by ceasing to operate at the premises from 29 July 2014 (_ie_, after the second flood) and failing to pay the outstanding rents for the premises.[^23] This is consistent with the terms of the Lease, which expressly states that “_\[u\]nless_ the \[plaintiff\] is in breach of the Lease, the \[plaintiff\] shall not be liable for any rent … during the Fitting-Out Period” \[emphasis added\].[^24] In breach of the Lease, the plaintiff in fact failed to pay rent timeously _and_ to keep the Suntec Clinic open during business hours for an extended period after the second flood,[^25] thereby justifying the landlord’s move to charge the plaintiff rent for the otherwise rent-free Fitting-Out period.

21     The landlord’s use of the plaintiff’s one-month advance rental payment to cover the rent for the fitting-out month of August 2013 appears therefore to have two causes: first, the plaintiff failed to pay its rent timeously to its landlord; second, the plaintiff ceased to operate the Suntec Clinic following the second flood.

22     Of the two causes, only the second cause involving the plaintiff’s failure to operate the Suntec Clinic flowed directly from the defendant’s breach of providing defective Works which caused the second flood. The first cause, namely the plaintiff’s failure to pay its rent timeously, appears to be caused _solely_ by the plaintiff, and is separate and distinct from the defendant’s breaches. Although Ms Chong had testified that the plaintiff had insufficient funds to set up and continue operations at the Suntec Clinic after the second flood,[^26] I note that the plaintiff did not specifically argue that its inability to pay its rent timeously was in part caused by the closure of the Suntec Clinic, which affected its cash flow from its revenue from patients (“patient revenue”) that would otherwise have been earned by having patients attend at its Suntec Clinic.

23     Furthermore, Ms Chong testified that as a company, the plaintiff’s position was “positive”.[^27] However, she refused to pay the rental money as she was attempting to renegotiate with the landlord for new premises so that the plaintiff could generate revenue and pay the rent.[^28] While awaiting these new premises which were never granted by the landlord, the Suntec Clinic was padlocked, and eventually repossessed.[^29]

24     Accordingly, I assume that the plaintiff had the financial capacity and sufficient cash flow at that time from its other clinics (which were generating revenue) or from its other ready sources of funds to help pay the rent timeously for the Suntec Clinic if it so wished. The rent was simply unpaid as the plaintiff was negotiating for alternative premises with its landlord, and did not wish to pay such rent unless and until it was granted such alternative premises.[^30] I therefore proceed on the basis that the plaintiff’s failure to pay its rent timeously was _solely_ caused by the plaintiff.

#### Principles relating to two causes for a contractual breach

25     When the breach of a contract is one of two causes, “\[t\]he contract-breaker is liable so long as his breach was ‘an’ effective cause of \[the plaintiff’s\] loss: the court need not choose which cause was the more effective” (_Chitty on Contracts_ vol 1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 33rd Ed, 2018) (“_Chitty on Contracts_”) at para 26-076). Similarly, in _Heskell v Continental Express Ltd and another_ \[1950\] 1 All ER 1033 (“_Heskell_”) at 1048, Devlin J observed that “\[i\]f a breach of contract is one of two causes, both co-operating and both of equal efficacy, … it is sufficient to carry judgment for damages.”.

26     These principles are made clear in the English Court of Appeal’s decision in _County Ltd and another v Girozentrale Securities_ \[1996\] 3 All ER 834 (“_County_”). In _County_, the plaintiff bank agreed to underwrite the issuance of 26 million shares in a publicly quoted company, R plc. The defendant stockbrokers were engaged by the plaintiff bank to approach potential investors. The plaintiff bank then informed the defendant broker and R plc that it would only proceed with the issue if institutional investors made commitments to subscribe for all the shares. However, in the letter of engagement to the defendant stockbrokers, the plaintiff bank stated that the brokers were to proceed “on the terms and conditions and strictly on the basis of the information contained in” the issue, and did not include any statement that the bank would only proceed with the issue if all the shares were subscribed. In breach of the letter of engagement, the defendant stockbrokers told institutional investors that the issue would only go ahead if it was fully subscribed. This was done in order to obtain indicative commitments from certain potential investors. The chairman of R plc also gave indicative commitments for six million of the shares on behalf of unnamed principals, with the result that there was an indication of 100% commitment for the placement. However, during the placement, some of R plc’s chairman’s unnamed principals did not take up the shares, with the result that 4.43 million shares were not taken up. Certain investors who had subscribed on the basis that the company would be fully subscribed therefore withdrew their subscriptions on the back of the defendant stockbrokers’ representations. This left the plaintiff bank, as underwriters, with shares on which it made a loss of £6,897,548.

27     The plaintiff bank sued the defendant stockbrokers. At first instance, the judge held that the defendant stockbroker’s breach was not the effective cause of the bank’s loss, as they were not of equal efficacy with the bank’s decision to accept the indicative commitments of R plc’s chairman without making proper inquiries. On appeal, the Court of Appeal clarified that the plaintiff bank’s conduct did not override the defendant stockbrokers’ breach, and the defendant was accordingly liable (_County_ at 849):

> … \[T\]he mere fact that the \[plaintiff’s\] failure to take reasonable precautions in its own interest could be regarded as an effective and concurrent cause … did not justify the conclusion that \[the defendant’s\] breach of contract was not an effective cause.

> For my part _I would not agree that the conduct of \[the plaintiff\] could be regarded as of greater efficacy but, even if it could, it certainly did not displace the efficacy of \[the defendant’s\] breach_. Accordingly, I would hold that \[the defendant\] was in breach of the terms of its engagement as brokers and that its breach caused \[the plaintiff\] the loss claimed. I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judge's order and enter judgment for \[the plaintiff\] for damages to be assessed.

> \[emphasis added\]

28     Similarly, in _Heskell_, the plaintiff had agreed to sell goods to a Persian buyer by a shipment. On 19 November 1946, the plaintiff instructed the first defendant, which warehoused the goods, to despatch the goods to the dock. By their admitted negligence, the first defendant did not do so, and the goods were accordingly not sent to the dock. Later, on 5 December 1946, a bill of lading in respect of the goods was issued by the second defendant, who had allocated cargo space to the plaintiff for the goods, notwithstanding the fact that the goods were never received at the dock and thus not shipped. The ship that was intended to deliver the plaintiff’s goods eventually arrived at the Persian Gulf without the goods. The buyer eventually claimed a substantial sum from the plaintiff, mainly covering the loss of profit which he would have made on a re-sale of the goods. The plaintiff took out a claim against both defendants.

29     A review of the above facts reveals that there were two causes for the plaintiff’s loss, namely the first defendant’s failure to despatch the goods to the dock and the second defendant’s negligence in issuing a bill of lading when the goods had never been received from the first defendant. In holding that the first defendant was liable, Devlin J held that “\[t\]he issue of the bill of lading could not extinguish the \[warehousing company’s\] breach of duty as a causative event; the breach being continuing is a continuous source of damage. But the two were equally operative causes in that if either had ceased the damage would have ceased” (_Heskell_ at 1047). Accordingly, the two causes were “both co-operating and both of equal efficacy”, and the first defendant’s breach was “sufficient to carry judgment for damages” (_Heskell_ at 1048).

#### The defendant’s breach was an effective cause of the plaintiff being charged for the rent-free Fitting-Out period

30     In this case, the landlord applied the one-month advance rental payment paid by the plaintiff to cover the rent for August 2013. The Statement of Claim by the landlord reveals that _both_ the plaintiff’s failure to pay the rent timeously _and_ to resume business at the Suntec Clinic were the operative causes for the plaintiff being charged rent for the month of August 2013,[^31] which would otherwise have fallen within the rent-free Fitting-Out period. There is nothing to indicate that one of the two causes was more efficacious than the other. Accordingly, the defendant’s breach which caused the second flood and which led to the plaintiff being unable to resume business at the Suntec Clinic was an effective cause of the plaintiff being charged rent of what was otherwise a rent-free Fitting-Out period. This is sufficient on the authorities above to render the defendant liable for the one-month advance payment that was used up in part payment of the two months’ rent-free Fitting-Out period.

31     The query then turns to whether circumstances exist which would reduce the amount recoverable by the plaintiff.

### No failure to mitigate

32     In this regard, the defendant alleges that the plaintiff ought to have mitigated its losses and paid the rent first.[^32] By failing to pay its rent timeously, the landlord charged the plaintiff for the rent-free Fitting-Out period, and it is accordingly “inherently unfair and unreasonable” for the defendant to be liable for the rent-free Fitting-Out period.[^33]

33     As explained, both the plaintiff’s failure to pay the rent _and_ the closure occasioned by the defendant’s breach were the effective causes of the plaintiff being charged for the rent-free Fitting-Out period. Hence, even if the plaintiff had continued to pay the rent to its landlord, there is no evidence to show that the landlord would not have repossessed the Suntec Clinic and charged the plaintiff for the rent-free Fitting-Out period. In fact, the plaintiff clearly took mitigatory steps by entering into the settlement agreement with the landlord, whereby it would only pay rent up until 29 March 2015[^34] instead of until 21 September 2016,[^35] the latter being the contractually-agreed end date for the Lease.

34     With the early termination of the Lease as part of the settlement agreement, the extent of the defendant’s liability in damages to the plaintiff from 30 March 2015 (the date of termination of the Lease) to 21 September 2016 (the contractually-agreed end-date of the Lease) is reduced. This is because the defendant would no longer be liable for the losses in revenue suffered by the plaintiff, as no such revenue could have been generated after the Suntec Clinic had been repossessed following the early termination. Instead, the defendant is only liable to the plaintiff for the proportionate part of capital expenses in setting up the Suntec Clinic that could not be depreciated over the surrendered portion of the Lease and thus was wasted and had to be written off. Had there been no early termination, the plaintiff could claim a loss of **$830.76 per day** (see \[81\] below) based on the loss of revenue suffered by the plaintiff on a per-day basis, after deducting variable expenses which were saved. With early termination, the plaintiff’s loss is limited to **$243.25 per day** based on the wasted capital expenses on a per-day basis (see \[107\] below). The main contribution to the large loss reduction is the savings by the plaintiff in not having to pay anymore rent. It would have made no commercial sense for the plaintiff to continue to pay rent for premises that it could no longer use as a dental clinic. Hence, the premature termination of the Lease constitutes a clear step towards mitigating damages on the plaintiff’s part.

35     Hence, I allow the plaintiff’s claim of $17,886.60, being one month’s rent paid for August 2013, which rent was payable due to the defendant’s breach in providing inadequate Works.

36     I note that the plaintiff also had to pay the rent in arrears for an additional month (being 22 July 2013 to 31 July 2013 and 1 September 2013 to 21 September 2013, a total of 31 days) of the otherwise two months’ rent-free Fitting-Out period.[^36] This additional month of rent was settled as part of the sum of $177,570.09 (without GST) paid to the landlord for the early termination of the Lease. For the same reasons, I allow a further sum of $17,886.60 being another one month’s rent as damages which would be conveniently placed under Category 2, to take into account all the rent charged by the landlord for the otherwise two months’ rent-free Fitting-Out period.

37     Accordingly, the amount of damages allowed under **Category 2** is **$35,773.20.**

## Category 3:   Losses caused by the floods

38     Turning to Category 3, the heads of claim are separated into two sub-categories, which I will deal with in turn.

### Category 3a:   Flood investigation and remediation costs

39     Category 3a comprises the plaintiff’s claims for payments which it had allegedly made to vendors for remediating the aftermath of the second flood.

40     Having considered the evidence, my decision with respect to each head of claim under Category 3a is as follows:

### Category 3b:   Loss of management time and expense

42     According to the plaintiff, the loss flowed from management time and effort which could have been directed to work related to the plaintiff’s business, but were instead directed by the aforementioned parties to:[^92]

> (a)     Manage the delay in completing the Works from 12 September 2013 to 31 October 2013;[^93]

> (b)     Manage the patients after the discovery of the first and second flood at the Suntec Clinic; and

> (c)     Remove equipment, documents and other items from the Suntec Clinic, as well as the storage of these equipment, documents and other items.

43     Preliminarily, it is clear that the claim for the “\[l\]oss of revenue that could have been earned by Dr Tan”,[^94] which is calculated based on the revenue he _could have_, but _did not_ generate for the Suntec Clinic as a result of the Blackout Periods,[^95] is in fact a claim for a loss of revenue, which will be dealt with under Categories 4a and 4b later. To prevent double counting, this head of claim under Category 3b is rejected.

44     In any event, while Dr Tan had previously worked at the Suntec Clinic _before_ its relocation (“the old Suntec Clinic”) to the new Suntec Clinic, the evidence shows that after the old Suntec Clinic closed on 28 February 2013, he never returned to work as a dentist (and therefore never generated patient revenue) at the new Suntec Clinic after it opened on 1 November 2013.[^96] Hence, there is simply no loss of revenue suffered by Dr Tan as a result of the repeated closures of the new Suntec Clinic that was occasioned by the defendant’s breach, as Dr Tan was continuing his work as a dentist at the plaintiff’s other clinics. Hence, putting the issue of double-counting aside, there is in fact no loss of patient revenue generation by Dr Tan for the plaintiff’s business.

45     Furthermore, insofar as the plaintiff is suggesting that Dr Tan had to use up more time _qua_ director to supervise the remediation works at the Suntec Clinic, and thus could not generate as much patient revenue for the plaintiff as a dentist, it would be reasonable to expect Dr Tan to find his own spare time beyond that needed to attend to all of his patients in order to manage the plaintiff’s business at the new Suntec Clinic _qua_ director. By agreeing to be a director of the plaintiff, Dr Tan has, regardless of whether the clinic was fully operational or closed for repairs, accepted that it is a requisite part of his duties as a director of the plaintiff to attend to and resolve business problems as and when they arise for which he would be remunerated by way of director’s fees or a salary if he was an executive director. The plaintiff should not be expected to pay Dr Tan more director’s fees or additional salary as an executive director merely for attending to some of the plaintiff’s problems arising from the remedial or repair works undertaken during the clinic’s closure _eg_ in advising Ms Chong, if required, on how to manage the flood investigation and remediation. In any event, I find that Ms Chong is very competent and fully capable of and was in fact largely managing these remedial or repair works on her own. She appears to me to be the one entirely in charge of these matters and Dr Tan was adopting a largely hands-off approach. I doubt that much time was spent by Dr Tan as a director in advising Ms Chong on how to handle these matters. Accordingly, no additional damages would be allowed to the plaintiff on account of Dr Tan’s very limited time spent in his capacity as a director in advising Ms Chong, which I believe has no adverse impact on Dr Tan’s patient revenue generation capacity for the plaintiff.

46     Turning to claims for fixed salary expenses paid to Ms Chong, Irish and Onihana, it is not disputed that the plaintiff had to continue paying their salaries plus CPF and other foreign worker levies (if any) even when the Suntec Clinic was not operational due to the defendant’s breach. As such, I am treating them as permanent salaried staff of the plaintiff. During the Blackout Periods, there would have been a dearth of patient-related work at the Suntec Clinic, such that these permanent salaried staff would have devoted their work hours towards remediating the floods.

47     Hence, unless these permanent salaried staff had to work overtime to remediate the floods, the salaries paid to them during the Blackout Periods will simply be treated as part of the wasted fixed expenses, which is dealt with under Category 4a below. In this regard, I have not seen any evidence in support of any such overtime payments made to Ms Chong, Irish and Onihana during the Blackout Periods.

48     Since the defendant is already liable to compensate the plaintiff for the wasted fixed salary expenses paid to these salaried staff during the Blackout Periods under Category 4a, any diversion of time by the permanent salaried staff to attend to the defendant’s breach should not be additionally compensated for by the defendant under Category 3b. Otherwise, the issue of double compensation arises.

49     Accordingly, all salary claims under Category 3b are dismissed. The claim made for the loss of revenue that Dr Tan could have generated as a dentist of the Suntec Clinic is dismissed as the evidence reveals that Dr Tan did not work at the new Suntec Clinic even when it was operational and did not have to spend much time as a director attending to the flooding issues at the Suntec Clinic. The salaries paid to the permanent staff by the plaintiff during the Blackout Periods will be taken into account as wasted fixed expenses under Category 4a, and are dismissed under Category 3b to avoid double counting.

## Category 4:   Losses arising from closure of Suntec Clinic during the Blackout Periods and early termination of Lease by landlord

50     Turning to Category 4, the plaintiff claims for losses which it incurred during the Blackout Periods. Category 4 is sub-categorised as follows:[^97]

> (a)     Category 4a: Wasted operating costs;

> (b)     Category 4b: Loss of profits;

> (c)     Category 4c: Wasted capital expenses; and

> (d)     Category 4d: Other damages in connection with the early termination of the Lease.

51     For ease of understanding, I have decided to amalgamate the claims under Categories 4a and 4b when assessing the losses for the Blackout Periods ending on 5 March 2015. Category 4c (which deals with wasted depreciation and rent from 6 March 2015 onwards) and Category 4d (which deals with other losses related to the early termination of the Lease) are then dealt with individually.

### Permissible to claim for expectation and reliance loss

52     Preliminarily, under Category 4, the plaintiff claims for wasted operating costs, loss of profit, wasted capital expenses, and other damages in connection with the early termination of the Lease.[^98] This appears to offend the general principle that a plaintiff must elect between expectation losses and reliance losses which flow from the defendant’s breach(es) (_Alvin Nicholas Nathan v Raffles Assets (Singapore) Pte Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2016\] 2 SLR 1056</span> (“_Alvin Nicholas_”) at \[24\]–\[25\]):

> 24    Following this principle, damages for breach of contract are ordinarily assessed in terms of the claimant’s _expectation loss_, which refers to the value of the benefit that the claimant would have obtained but for the breach of contract, or, to put it another way, the gains the claimant expected as a result of the full performance of the contract: Andrew Phang Boon Leong, _The Law of Contract in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“_The Law of Contract_”) at para 21.033. On occasion, damages for breach of contract may be quantified in terms of the claimant’s _reliance loss_ – that is, the costs and expenses the claimant incurred in reliance on the defendant’s contracted-for performance, but which were wasted because of the breach of contract: _The Law of Contract_ at para 21.034. The basis for awarding reliance loss is the assumption that were the contract performed, the claimant would have at least fully recovered the costs and expenditure incurred: _Van Der Horst Engineering Pte Ltd v Rotol Singapore Ltd_ <span class="citation">\[2006\] 2 SLR(R) 586</span> at \[54\]–\[55\]. Indeed, in cases where a claimant enters into a bad bargain and would not have recovered all his costs/expenditure even if the contract had been performed, his losses may not be quantified by reference to his reliance expenditure: _C & P Haulage v Middleton_ \[1983\] 1WLR 1461 at 1468. Thus, the underlying principle, _even in cases where reliance loss is awarded_, is to place the innocent party in the position he would have been in _had the contract been performed_.

> 25    It should be noted that claims for expectation losses and reliance losses are generally _alternative_ claims: The Law of Contract at para 21.037. As this court held in _Hong Fok v Bima_ at \[59\]:

>> \[A\] plaintiff cannot claim wasted expenditure and loss of profit at the same time. The reason is that a claim for profit is made on the hypothesis that the expenditure had been incurred …

> Indeed, if a court awards a claimant _both_ expectation and reliance losses following a breach of contract, the claimant would have been put in an even better position than he would have been in if the contract had been wholly performed. He would effectively have obtained the gains he expected as a result of the full performance of the contract, yet would not have had to incur the necessary costs in securing those gains. The claimant would thus be over-compensated.

> \[emphasis in original\]

53     As seen in the passage in _Alvin Nicholas_, the reason for the general principle of requiring a plaintiff to elect between expectation and reliance losses is to ensure that the plaintiff is not put in a better position than it would have been in if the contract is fully performed but for the defendant’s breach. This is to avoid double compensation to the plaintiff. As a result, generally, a claim for both loss of profits and wasted expenditure, as the plaintiff has done in this case, would be impermissible.

54     However, such general principles as espoused in _Alvin Nicholas_ are only applicable when the loss of profits are claimed on a _gross_ basis, and do not apply in cases where the loss of profits are claimed on a _net_ basis. As observed in Andrew Phang Boon Leong, _The Law of Contract in Singapore_ (Academy Publishing, 2012) (“_The Law of Contract_”) at para 21.038:

> These observations \[that a plaintiff cannot claim wasted expenditure _and_ loss of profits at the same time\] are unobjectionable and perfectly in keeping with the desire to avoid double compensation of the claimant, but only where the “loss of profits” has been ascertained on a _gross_ basis, without taking into account the expenditures and costs that would have had to be spent in order to generate those “profits”. However, **where the claim as to “loss of profits” has been made on a** **_net_** **basis, and a separate claim is then made as to the “reliance losses” in terms of the expenses and costs that had been incurred and which would have had to be incurred to enable the claimant to earn the** **_net_** **profits, there would be** **_no_** **double-counting**. Hence, there is nothing to bar a claim for both “expectation” as well as “reliance” losses. **In such a case, a claim on the reliance basis for wasted expenditure is** **_complementary_** **and not duplicative**. Thus, there ought to be no issue as to election between a claim on the expectation basis for the loss of **net** profit, and a claim on the reliance basis for wasted expenditure. \[emphasis in original in italics, emphasis added in bold\]

55     Similarly, the author of _Chitty on Contracts_ at para 26-032:

> … In principle, the claimant should be entitled to claim damages **both for his wasted expenditure** incurred up to the date of his terminating the contract and **also for the** **_net_** **loss of profit** which he would have made but for the breach. There can be no valid objection to this, provided the calculations show that there is no overlapping in the claimant’s recovery … \[emphasis added in bold and italics\]

56     A hypothetical scenario aptly demonstrates this. In the hypothetical, an entity owns a shop. The cost of the entity’s permanent staff and its rental is $8 per month. For expending the fixed expenses of $8 a month, the entity makes $10 per month in total revenue, thereby earning a monthly net profit of $2. If, due to another entity’s breach (_eg_, defective works), the entity is unable to open its shop for a month, the entity would still have to expend $8 a month in paying its permanent staff and rental, as such expenses are fixed expenses which do not depend on whether the shop is opened or not. This $8 would be wasted fixed expenditure, as the entity would not be able to generate any revenue while its shop is closed due to the other entity’s defective works. If the entity is only allowed to claim for its loss of net profit in this case, the entity’s claim would be $2, which would not even cover the entity’s wasted fixed expenditure of $8. Hence, to ensure that the entity is put in the same position as it would have been but for the breach, the damages due to the entity ought to be $10, being the sum of the entity’s net profits and wasted fixed expenditure. This $10 would be used to offset the entity’s wasted fixed expenditure of $8, leaving the entity with the $2 net profit which it would have earned but for the other entity’s breach.

57     Let me extend this same example further. Assume that the cost of the entity’s permanent staff and its rental is $12 per month. However, its total revenue remains the same at $10 per month. The shop therefore makes a net loss of $2 per month when it is operational. Does it mean that no damages can be established against a defendant whose defective works caused the shop to be closed for several months simply because it is continuously a loss-making entity? The answer is negative. The defendant has still caused the shop owner to be deprived of his revenue stream of $10 per month, which he could have used to help to defray his own wasted fixed expenses of $12 per month. The defendant must still be liable to compensate the shop owner $10 per month for each month of closure, leaving the shop owner to bear his net loss of $2 per month. This will be exactly the same as the situation if his shop is open. However, if the erroneous position is adopted that no compensation is due from the defendant simply because it is a loss making entity, then the shop owner’s original loss of $2 per month (with no breach) will have increased to $12 per month (with breach). It is clear that the contractual measure of damage to put the shop owner in the same position as if the contract is fulfilled will not be met unless compensation of $10 per month is ordered against the defendant. This shows that it is the revenue stream of the shop owner that has been disrupted or extinguished by the defendant’s breach that is of major significance in quantifying the damage which the defendant will be liable for.

### Categories 4a and 4b:    Two possible alternative bases of claim for damages - Basis (a) or Basis (b)

58     Having determined that a claim for net profit _and_ wasted expenses is not at odds with principle, the plaintiff has two possible _alternative_ bases of claim for damages under both Categories 4a and 4b taken as a whole:

> (a)      **Basis (a):** “Revenue” minus “Variable Expenses”:

>> (i)       “Revenue” refers to the dental fees that could have been charged to the patients of the Suntec Clinic, assuming that the clinic was fully operational.

>> (ii)       “Variable Expenses” refers to expenses that would not be incurred if the clinic is not operational but would necessarily be incurred had the clinic been operational in order to earn that “Revenue”. Examples of “Variable Expenses” are the cost of consumables like anaesthesia, cotton wool, dental amalgam and X-Ray films used up for the dental treatment of patients, the cost of medication issued to patients and the cost of engaging locum dentists (_ie_, dentists who work on a part-time basis, dentists who are not paid fixed monthly wages but are paid based on the amount of patient revenue generated).

> (b)      **Basis (b):** “Net Profit” plus “Fixed Expenses”:

>> (i)       “Net Profit” refers to the total “Revenue” minus “Total Expenses”, which comprises “Fixed Expenses” _and_ “Variable Expenses”. Its value is hence contingent on the “Revenue”, “Fixed Expenses” and “Variable Expenses” of the company.

>> (ii)       “Fixed Expenses” refers to expenses which would necessarily be incurred whether or not the clinic was operation. Examples of “Fixed Expenses” are the rent for the clinic, salaries of permanent staff which are generally fixed in nature and independent of the amount of the patient revenue generated, and depreciation expenses arising from the capital expenditure or setting-up costs which would generally be depreciated over the term of the Lease.

59     The plaintiff cannot claim for both Basis (a) and Basis (b) above as that would amount to a double claim for Categories 4a and 4b combined. The business equations from which I derive Basis (a) and Basis (b) are as follows:

Revenue – Total Expenses = Net Profit

Total Expenses = Fixed Expenses + Variable Expenses

Revenue – Fixed Expenses – Variable Expenses = Net Profit

Revenue = Net Profit + Fixed Expenses + Variable Expenses

Revenue – Variable Expenses = Net Profit + Fixed Expenses

_Basis (a) = Basis (b)_

_\[In the above equations, the_ **_depreciation_** _of the “Capital Cost” in setting up the new Suntec Clinic over the duration of the Lease (ie “_ **_Depreciation Expense_** _”) is to be treated as part of the “Fixed Expenses”.\]_

60     As demonstrated by the equations above, for a fully operational business, the “Revenue” received _minus_ the “Variable Expenses” spent in earning the “Revenue” is _exactly equal_ to the “Net Profit” earned _plus_ the “Fixed Expenses” (inclusive of “Depreciation Expense”).

61     For the converse situation when the business is non-operational because of a breach of a contract, the “Revenue” lost _minus_ the “Variable Expenses” saved is _exactly equal_ to the “Net Profit” lost _plus_ the “Fixed Expenses” (inclusive of “Depreciation Expense”) wasted. This is also equal to the total losses under Categories 4a and 4b combined.

62     Expressing the plaintiff's claim in such equations, it can be seen that Category 4a, which comprises wasted fixed expenses such as wasted rent and season parking,[^99] relates to claims for wasted “Fixed Expenses”. Category 4b is then a claim for the loss of “Net Profits”. Hence, Category 4a + Category 4b = “Net Profit” + “Fixed Expenses” = Basis (b) = Basis (a).

63     As a matter of principle, the plaintiff is entitled to choose _either_ to claim under Basis (b) for _both_ the loss of _net_ profits and the wasted _fixed_ expenses (inclusive of Depreciation Expense) that it had incurred during the Blackout Periods _or_ to claim under Basis (a) for the patient revenue it lost during the Blackout Periods less the variable costs that are saved during the closure of the Suntec Clinic. Proceeding under either basis should yield the same answer or result. There will be no double counting so long as aspects of Basis (a) are not claimed under Basis (b) and _vice versa_.

64     In my view, the better basis to adopt in each case is the basis that enables a fairly reliable answer to be more easily arrived at. Sometimes the manner in which the information has been collected by the business entity, or the evidence that happens to be available is such that it allows for an easier computation using Basis (a) rather than Basis (b), or _vice versa_.

65     Given the nature of the evidence adduced before me in this case, I think that proceeding on Basis (a) will be far easier and more likely to give a more reliable estimate for the total losses under both Categories 4a and 4b combined than proceeding on the more complicated Basis (b), which the plaintiff has done.

66     I will now proceed to compute using Basis (a).

#### Computation using Basis (a) for damages for the Blackout Periods ending on 5 March 2015

67     As mentioned, Basis (a) has two elements:

> (a)     First, the Revenue lost during the Blackout Periods will have to be established. This is to be computed by determining the estimated potential Revenue that could have been earned from patients of the Suntec Clinic had the clinic been fully operational during the Blackout Periods, which spanned a total of **321** days, as computed at \[3\] above.

> (b)     Second, all the Variable Expenses (but _not_ the Fixed Expenses) that would have, but which were not in fact incurred due to the Suntec Clinic’s closure during the Blackout Periods (spanning 321 days), will have to be deducted from the lost Revenue. This is because no such Variable Expenses was in fact incurred by the plaintiff during the Blackout Periods. Hence, to reflect the true extent of loss suffered by the plaintiff due to the repeated closures of its Suntec Clinic, the Variable Expenses must be deducted from the Revenue that could have been earned.

##### (1)   Loss of potential revenue

68     To determine the potential Revenue that was lost during the Blackout Periods, the plaintiff provided the following reliable and accurate records of the actual gross revenues (without GST) from patients attending at both the old and the new Suntec Clinics on a month to month basis:[^100]

69     In my view, it will be far more reliable to rely on the historical data captured by the plaintiff for its patient revenue for the months that are _more_ proximate to the Blackout Periods to determine the potential revenue that Suntec Clinic could have generated had it been fully operational. The patient revenue for those months that are _less_ proximate to the Blackout Periods will be less relevant and less reliable, in particular as the Suntec Clinic was shifted to its new location after the closure on 28 February 2013. I accept that many factors influence the patient revenue. In the absence of any other reliable indicators or relevant data and having been given primarily the historical data on patient revenue, I can do no better than to make use of such available data to derive some meaningful average patient revenue figures to serve as an estimation of the patient revenue that was lost during the Blackout Periods.

70     I have decided that the patient revenue figures for the old Suntec Clinic are inappropriate for use as a proxy to estimate the patient revenue for the Blackout Periods for the new Suntec Clinic. This is for several reasons.

71     First, the old Suntec Clinic figures (between January 2012 and February 2013) are rather dated and might not be reflective of the potential patient revenue for the much later Blackout Periods which occurred predominately in the second half of the year 2014 and in early 2015.

72     More importantly, the old Suntec Clinic had three to four dentists stationed there, with Dr Tan being the permanent anchor dentist bringing in the most patient revenue every month. The other dentists, Dr Nancy Wong, Dr Frank Lee and Dr Alvin Yeo were each bringing in much less patient revenue than Dr Tan. As an example, in March 2012, the old Suntec Clinic’s patient revenue was $188,987.03. Of the total revenue, $117,095.48 was earned by Dr Tan, while the remainder was earned by Dr Nancy Wong, Dr Frank Lee _and_ Dr Alvin Yeo collectively.[^106] However, when the new Suntec Clinic opened in November 2013, Dr Tan was no longer stationed at the new Suntec Clinic as he was already transferred to work at the plaintiff’s other clinics, leaving only Dr Nancy Wong and Dr Frank Lee to man the Suntec Clinic permanently. Much later, in May 2014, another dentist, Dr Anna Maragopoulou, joined the new Suntec Clinic, but the patient revenue brought in by Dr Anna Maragopoulou was much lower than Dr Nancy Wong and Dr Frank Lee, who themselves earned far less than Dr Tan previously had.[^107] The major contributor of patient revenue (_ie_, Dr Tan) was no longer working at the new Suntec Clinic. Accordingly, to derive estimates of the potential patient revenue stream lost for the new Suntec Clinic during the Blackout Periods based on the patient revenue stream of the old Suntec Clinic, when Dr Tan was no longer there, would pull up the revenue figures significantly for the new Suntec Clinic, and would unfairly skew the estimate upwards when it is clear to me that the new Suntec Clinic was in fact structured and manned very differently from the old Suntec Clinic.

73     For the reasons stated, it is in my view wholly inappropriate to use the patient revenue figures of the old Suntec Clinic to estimate the potential patient revenue stream for the Blackout Periods of the new Suntec Clinic.

74     Accordingly, I adopt instead all the patient revenue figures during which the new Suntec Clinic was operational between 12 September 2013 and 5 March 2015 for the purpose of my estimation. The total patient revenue (without GST) generated when the new Suntec Clinic was operational for a total of **219 days** was **$454,843.44**.[^108] Therefore, the estimated average patient revenue (without GST) for the new Suntec Clinic is $454, 843.44 ÷ 219 = **$2,076.91 per operational day**.

75     Due to the defendant’s breach, the Suntec Clinic was non-operational for a total of **321 days** during the same period between 12 September 2013 and 5 March 2015. The breakdown of the **321 days** of non-operation constituting the Blackout Periods allowed in the Liability Judgment as set out above at \[2\] consists of:

> (a)     the delayed completion of fitting-out of the Suntec Clinic: 12 September 2013 to 31 October 2013 **(50 days)**;

> (b)     the closure from the first flood: 17 January 2014 to 8 March 2014 **(51 days)**;

> (c)     the closure from the second flood: 29 July 2014 to 5 March 2015 **(220 days)**.

76     The element of total patient revenue deemed to be lost for the purpose of computation of damages under Basis (a) is therefore **321 days**×**$2,076.91 per day** = **$666,688.33** (the “derived lost patient revenue”).

##### (2)   Deemed variable expenses saved during the Blackout Periods

77     What is not known is the total amount of variable expenses to be deducted from this amount if the Suntec Clinic had been fully operational and attending to patients for all these **321 days**. As explained earlier, variable expenses would include payment for the purchase of consumables used in the course of dental treatment, the cost of medicine dispensed to patients, as well as payments for part-time staff and locum dentists employed (if any). Unlike fixed expenses, these variable expenses are costs that were saved when the Suntec Clinic was non-operational.

78     To estimate the variable expenses for the period of **321 days** had the new Suntec Clinic been operational when in fact it was not, I have to rely on financial data provided by the plaintiff. The court was provided with actual variable expenses incurred by the old Suntec Clinic for the year 2012 and the actual variable expenses incurred by the new Suntec Clinic for the years 2013 and 2014 when it was operational for a total of **219 days**. I have decided to use only the financial data on variable expenses for the new Suntec Clinic when it was operational for the **219 days** to estimate the variable expenses that the new Suntec Clinic would have incurred if it had not been closed for the **321 days**. For the same reasons set out in \[69\]–\[72\] above, it is inappropriate to use the figures for the old Suntec Clinic for the year 2012 to estimate the variable expenses for the new Suntec Clinic. Accordingly, the variable expenses for both the years 2013 and 2014 for the new Suntec Clinic will be used for the purpose of my estimation and they represent the best available data for this purpose. This approach is also more consistent as the estimation of the potential patient revenue for the **321 days** were the new Suntec Clinic operational is also based on the patient revenue figures for the new Suntec Clinic for the years 2013 and 2014, and not the patient revenue figures for the old Suntec Clinic for the year 2012.

79     In a letter dated 23 August 2019, the plaintiff furnished a “STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME” for the new Suntec Clinic, which reflected that the actual patient revenues for the years 2013 and 2014 were $418,632 and $302,816 respectively.[^109] The total patient revenue for these two years is therefore **$721,448**. The variable expense after pro-rating certain heads of expense which were incurred by the Suntec Clinic for the plaintiff’s other clinics was stated to be $214,712 and $212,311 for the years 2013 and 2014 respectively. The total variable expense for these two years is therefore **$427,023**.[^110] The average ratio of variable expense to total revenue is $427,023 ÷ $721,448 = **59.19%** for these two years. Alternatively, if I were to compute the ratio of variable expense to total patient revenue _separately_ for each of the years 2013 and 2014, and thereafter derive an average from these two ratios obtained, the average ratio computed in this manner would be **60.70%**.[^111] This ratio approach is adopted as it is a reasonable assumption that variable expenses will generally increase when more patients are attended to and more patient revenue is generated, unlike fixed expenses. There is probably a fairly good positive correlation between patient revenue and variable expenses.

80     As a rough approximation, I will therefore use a ratio of **60%** of total variable expense to total patient revenue to estimate the total variable expense that would have been incurred had the clinic been operational for the **321 days** of actual closure of the Suntec Clinic during the Blackout Periods. This works out to be **60%** of **$666,688.33** = **$400,013**, which is the deemed total variable expense for the **321 days** had the clinic been operational to earn patient revenue.

81     The computation using Basis (a) would be the total deemed “Revenue” minus the total deemed “Variable Expense” = **$666,688.33 - $400,013 = $266,675.33**. This represents the loss of patient revenue to the plaintiff after deducting variable expenses for the **321 days** of the Blackout Periods, and also reflects the sum total of the “loss of net profits” plus “wasted fixed expenses” (inclusive of “wasted depreciation expenses”) for the **321 days** of the Blackout Periods. In other words, this amount of damages of **$266,675.33** (_ie_, $830.76 per day) computed under Basis (a) is also equivalent to the damages that would have been computed under Basis (b) (see \[59\] which explains their equivalence).

#### Issue:   “Diversion effect” against “Disruption effect”.

##### (1)   Diversion of the plaintiff’s patients from the Suntec Clinic

82     While the _prima facie_ damages due to the plaintiff under Categories 4a and 4b is **$266,675.33**, an issue raised by the defendant is that the plaintiff suffered no loss of patient revenue during the Blackout Periods due to the diversion of patients to the plaintiff’s other dental clinics (the “Diversion effect”).[^112]

83     The basis to support this Diversion effect appears to be the evidence of Mr Wong King Kheng (“Mr Wong”), who appeared on behalf of the defendant. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Wong opined that the Suntec Clinic’s patients could have been, and were indeed, diverted to the plaintiff’s new clinic at The Sail, 2 Marina Boulevard, #01-02 when the Suntec Clinic was closed.[^113]

84     To refute the allegation of the Diversion effect, Ms Chong explained that when the Suntec Clinic was closed, the patients were not automatically diverted to the plaintiff’s other clinics. Instead, the clinic operated on a recall system, whereby patients would be updated via messages that the clinic would be closing down, and that it would get back in touch with their patients when the clinic was re-opened.[^114] Patients were not directed to the plaintiff’s other clinics unless they asked.[^115] As for patients who did not ask to be directed to other clinics, but who were due for an appointment with the Suntec Clinic while it was closed, they were called to schedule an appointment at the Suntec Clinic after it reopened for business.[^116]

85     Ms Chong further explained that patients of dental clinics were very location-centric, and they could go to other clinics that did not belong to the plaintiff, and there was thus no formula that could explain whether patients would attend another clinic of the plaintiff’s or other clinics during the Blackout Periods.[^117] In this regard, there were other dental clinics in the vicinity of the Suntec Clinic.[^118]

86     In short, Ms Chong attempted to give the impression that the plaintiff had not _actively_ diverted its patients from the Suntec Clinic to its other clinics.

87     However, I find this to be wholly unconvincing, especially as the Blackout Periods stretched across significant periods, and often occurred abruptly (_eg_, the first flood), such that it would only be reasonable to expect the plaintiff to reschedule already scheduled patients (at the new Suntec Clinic) to its other clinics. Furthermore, it accords with common sense that some patients, having been regularly attended to by a particular dentist, would then “follow” that dentist for follow-up treatment, irrespective of whether the dentist continued to operate out of the Suntec Clinic. I am also inclined to believe that any sensible management would have tried to mitigate the consequences of the closure of the Suntec Clinic by actively diverting, where possible, its existing patients to the plaintiff’s other clinics to be seen by the same dentists transferred from the Suntec Clinic, whether it was for follow-up treatment or regular check-ups, especially as it was unclear when the Suntec Clinic could be re-opened after the flooding incidents.

88     In fact, Ms Chong stated in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the plaintiff had incurred a loss of $265,399.38 for the loss of management time and effort due to, _inter alia_, “\[m\]anagement of patients after discovery of the two (2) flooding incidents and _arrangements for these patients to be scheduled for appointments at \[the plaintiff’s\] other clinics_” \[emphasis added\].[^119] In my view, this confirms that active steps were indeed taken to divert patients to the plaintiff’s other dental clinics when the Suntec Clinic was closed after each of the floods.

89     Thus, I accept that there was at least _some_ diversion of the Suntec Clinic’s patients to the plaintiff’s other clinics.

##### (2)   Disruption from the repeated closures of the Suntec Clinic

90     However, according to the plaintiff, the delayed opening and repeated closures gave the plaintiff inadequate lead time to inform its patients of its reopening date(s),[^120] and rendered the clinic susceptible to the effects of the intermittent cessation of business throughout 2013 and 2014 (the “Disruption effect”). This caused its revenue to fall, as shown by the fall in revenue of the plaintiff’s Suntec Clinic from $1,729,807 in 2012 to $418,632 and $302,816 in 2013 and 2014 respectively.[^121]

91     As highlighted above, I note that Dr Tan, who was the dentist bringing in the most patient revenue at the old Suntec Clinic in 2012, was no longer working at the new Suntec Clinic when it opened in November 2013. Moreover, the old Suntec Clinic had three to four dentists working there whereas the new Suntec Clinic had in effect only two dentists; while a third dentist joined the new Suntec Clinic in May 2014, she only brought in about $3,000 in patient revenue each month, which was far less than the monthly average of about $30,000 brought in by the other two dentists.[^122] It is thus not surprising that the average _daily_ revenue for the old Suntec Clinic far exceeds that of the new Suntec Clinic. Hence, the large difference in the revenue figures between the old and the new Suntec Clinics does not _per se_ justify the plaintiff’s submission that the multiple closures during the Blackout Periods are mainly responsible for the drop in patient revenue in the new Suntec Clinic.

92     Nonetheless, related to the Diversion effect, while I am inclined to believe that efforts were taken to actively divert patients from the Suntec Clinic to the other clinics during the Blackout Periods, whether the patients who were diverted eventually went to the plaintiff’s other clinics for treatment and what proportion of them did so is an entirely different question.

93     While I accept that there was _some_ successful diversion of patients that could have mitigated the plaintiff’s losses during the Blackout Periods, no evidence is provided to me on how many patients actually went over to the plaintiff’s other clinics when their appointments were re-scheduled and how many failed to turn up on the dates of their re-scheduled appointments. Some probably did and some probably did not. For those who did attend at the plaintiff’s other clinics, it would not contribute to a loss of patient revenue at the new Suntec Clinic for the plaintiff (when treated as an entity). For those who did not, it would contribute to a loss of patient revenue at the new Suntec Clinic when it was closed due to the defendant’s breach. In short, while efforts were put towards diverting patients to the plaintiff’s other clinics, this did not necessitate the conclusion that no loss was thereby suffered by the plaintiff due to the repeated closures.

94     Furthermore, the intermittent cessation of the plaintiff’s business would have adversely affected its ability to steadily build up an increasing patient revenue stream on a long term basis at the new Suntec Clinic. Thus, I am satisfied that the plaintiff had suffered _some_ amount of loss of patient revenue due to the Disruption effect, which must be quantified if that is at all possible.

##### (3)   Balancing the “Disruption effect” against the “Diversion effect”

95     In all, the fact of active diversion of patients from the Suntec Clinic to the patient’s other clinics (if successful) would reduce the actual daily lost revenue to the plaintiff during the Blackout Periods (_ie_, the Diversion effect). Considering the Diversion effect alone, the derived lost patient revenue figure at \[76\] above unduly _over-estimates_ the actual lost revenue for the plaintiff.

96     However, the Diversion effect must be balanced against the Disruption effect. As a result of repeated and intermittent closures suffered by the plaintiff’s Suntec Clinic, the plaintiff was unable to reach normal operational conditions even during the months in 2013 and 2014 when it was fully operational. This means that the revenue figures for the operational months of 2013 and 2014, which were utilised to compute the derived lost patient revenue (at \[74\] above), necessarily _under-estimates_ the amount of revenue that the plaintiff _could_ have earned at the Suntec Clinic, but for the defendant’s breaches causing the intermittent cessation of business.

97     In my view, the abovementioned Diversion effect would be cancelled out by the opposing Disruption effect to some extent. With no data available to enable a quantitative assessment of the magnitude of each of these opposing effects, it is not unreasonable for me to conclude that these opposing effects would cancel each other out to such a degree that it would not be really necessary for me to make any adjustments to the average patient revenue estimated at **$2,076.91 per day** at \[74\] and the derived lost patient revenue figure of **$666,688.33** (referred to at \[76\] above) for the **321 days** that the new Suntec Clinic was non-operational due to the defendant’s breach.

#### The plaintiff’s proposed adjustments to certain items in the management accounts before determining the revenue and the fixed and variable expenses of the new Suntec Clinic

98     Another point should be disposed of. In its Profit and Loss Statement tendered to the court for the purposes of assessing the Suntec Clinic’s revenue and expenses (both fixed and variable), the plaintiff proposes adding and/or pro-rating certain revenue and expense items.[^123]

99     In relation to the revenue item, the plaintiff proposes to add “Government Grants” which were received by the Suntec Clinic on behalf of the plaintiff’s other clinics (“the grants”).[^124] This is because the Suntec Clinic was the plaintiff’s flagship clinic, and was thus treated as the main branch of the Plaintiff’s suite of clinics.[^125] As the grants were received on behalf of the plaintiff’s other clinics, the plaintiff proposes to pro-rate such grants by the plaintiff’s four clinics, such that only a quarter of such the grants are to be added to the plaintiff’s revenue for the Suntec Clinic from 2012 to 2014.

100    I do not agree with the plaintiff’s proposed treatment of the grants. The grants of $612 (in 2013) and $8,040 (in 2014) ought to be removed from the revenue figure as they were in any event received by the plaintiff despite the defendant’s breach. The grants are therefore dissimilar from the patient revenue, which would depend on whether the clinic was opened or closed and the extent to which the patients could be successfully diverted to the plaintiff’s other clinics during the Blackout Periods. As the plaintiff continues to retain the benefit of the grants, it has therefore not suffered any loss of revenue with respect to these grants notwithstanding the defendant’s breaches which caused the repeated closure of the Suntec Clinic. Hence, I have not added the grants in determining the actual revenue earned by the Suntec Clinic in 2013 and 2014, which figures are utilised to estimate the potential revenue deemed to be lost for the Blackout Periods as a result of the defendant’s breaches.

101    The plaintiff also proposes that certain fixed expense items had to be divided by three, as they were “paid by the Suntec Clinic on behalf of the Plaintiff’s other clinics, namely the Mandarin Gallery and One Raffles Quay Clinics in 2012.”[^126]

102    As my computation is premised on Basis (a), I need not be concerned with how the fixed expenses (which fall to be determined under Basis (b) only) are to be divided as they do not feature in my computation. In any event, I note from the plaintiff’s Profit and Loss Statement that none of the variable expense items needed any adjustment or proration (_ie_, division of a variable expense item by the number of clinics which the plaintiff owned).[^127] Hence, I can rely on the accuracy of the variable expense figures set out for the Suntec Clinic for the years 2013 and 2014 for the purpose of arriving at the deemed variable expense that would have been incurred had the new Suntec Clinic been operational for the 321 days of the Blackout Periods. This is precisely what I have done above.

103    There is thus no need for me to make any adjustments to these variable expense figures nor the revenue figures. As such, the amount of damages allowed under Categories 4(a) and 4(b) combined is **$266,675.33** (see \[81\] above).

### Category 4c:   Wasted capital expenses

104    The entire capital expenses in setting up a business is normally depreciated evenly using a straight line method over the duration of the lease of the premises for the business. The capital depreciation whilst the business is operational is normally treated as part of the “Fixed Expenses” incurred for the business. When the business is non-operational for some reason, then these “Fixed Expenses” of capital depreciation will be wasted for that non-operational period.

#### Wasted depreciation (from 6 March 2015 to the end date of the Lease on 21 September 2016)

105    I begin by first computing the total capital expenditure incurred by the plaintiff when it set up the new Suntec Clinic. The capital expenditure consists of various items of costs incurred by the plaintiff to establish the new Suntec Clinic, such as the costs of moving into the new premises for the clinic, installing fixtures and fittings for the new clinic, and payments made to its contractor for fitting out the new clinic (“capital expenses”). The fruits of such capital expenses were expected to be enjoyed by the plaintiff throughout (a) the **10 days** of the Fitting-Out period from 12 September 2013 to 21 September 2013 when the new Suntec Clinic could be fully operational had the defendant completed its fitting-out contract for the plaintiff without any delay; and (b) the whole duration of the Lease, which was for three years or **1096 days**, commencing on 22 September 2013 and ending on 21 September 2016[^128], both of which would amount to a total of **1,106 days**. All the capital expenses would be assumed to be depreciated evenly over a total of **1,106 days**.

106    Having comprehensively considered the setting up costs for the new Suntec Clinic as well as the equipment that were bought by the plaintiff for the clinic, I have computed the total capital expenses to be **$269,037.71**,[^129] with my reasons as follows:

107    When the total capital expense of **$269,037.71** is depreciated evenly over a total of **1,106 days**, the average depreciation of the Suntec Clinic works out to be **$243.25 per day**.[^164]

108    The **1,106 days** can be divided into two periods. The first period is from 12 September 2013 to 5 March 2015, or a total of **540 days**. It relates to the period when the new Suntec Clinic was, or ought to have been, operational and earning patient revenue. In other words, there would have been no firm decision made for any permanent closure of the new Suntec Clinic during this period. Hence, assessment of damages is based on the loss of the patient revenue stream for the plaintiff which I have computed using Basis (a). The second period is from 6 March 2015 to the stipulated contractual end date of the Lease of three years on 21 September 2016, or a total of **566 days**. As can be seen, a very substantial part of this second period relates to the period _after_ the Suntec Clinic was repossessed by the landlord (_ie_, on 30 March 2015) due the plaintiff’s failure to resume business at the clinic and to pay the outstanding rent timeously.[^165] Essentially, the Suntec Clinic is to be regarded as having been permanently closed down with effect from 6 March 2015, which was even before the repossession of the premises by the landlord on 30 March 2015. Permanent closure of a newly set up shop is, to state the obvious, a very serious business decision for a business owner. The business owner would naturally have to take time to carefully evaluate his available options before making the irreversible final decision to do so. Once the decision to permanently close down the clinic is made, the unexpired part of the Lease would have to be dealt with as soon as possible, and the best outcome would be for the landlord to agree to accept the return of the premises and to forgo charging anymore rent for the balance of the unexpired Lease. That appears to me to be the eventual outcome of the settlement with the landlord, as rent was only charged until 29 March 2015[^166] instead of the contractually stipulated end-date of 21 September 2016,[^167]

109    For the purposes of calculating the wasted capital expense, I therefore proceed on the basis that the clinic was effectively permanently closed down from 6 March 2015 onwards, even though rent had to be paid until 29 March 2015 as part of the settlement with the landlord.[^168]

110    The depreciation amount for the first 540 days (_ie_, the first period) is not needed as the capital expense was not “wasted” during that period, since I am awarding the plaintiff damages for the loss of revenue which it suffered during the delayed opening of the Suntec Clinic and the Blackout Periods that occurred during the first period (under Basis (a) above). The depreciation amount also relates to “fixed expenses”, which only fall to be calculated under Basis (b), which I have not adopted.

111    However, the wasted depreciation for the second period of 566 days must be computed as damages to be additionally paid by the defendant under Category 4c (wasted capital expenses). Since the Suntec Clinic is to be regarded as having been permanently closed down from 6 March 2015 onwards, no computation under Basis (a) would be appropriate for this period. No deemed patient revenue lost should be attributed to the defendant because the clinic is to be treated as permanently closed. Instead, mitigatory steps to return the premises and stop the rent from further accruing would be a primary consideration. However, the capital expenses expended for setting up the new Suntec Clinic which are intended for pro-rated depreciation over the second period (_ie_ had the clinic been operational) nevertheless continues as wasted capital expenses, for which the defendant remains liable to compensate the plaintiff.

112    Based on the average depreciation expense of **$243.25 per day** (see \[107\] above), the wasted depreciation for the whole of the second period of **566 days** from 6 March 2015 to 21 September 2016 amounts to **$137,681.14**.[^169]

#### Wasted rent (from 6 March 2015 to 29 March 2015 prior to repossession by the landlord

113    Furthermore, as noted at \[108\], rent was in fact charged by the landlord until 29 March 2015,[^170] even though the plaintiff might have regarded the clinic as having been permanently closed down on 6 March 2015. Hence, rent was in fact wasted from 6 March 2015 to 29 March 2015, or for 24 days. This wasted rent forms the second component of Category 4c, and amounts to **$13,703.04[^171] for 24 days** after pro-rating based on the average rent of **$570.96 per day[^172]** computed from the settlement sum of **$177,750.09** (without GST) for the rent in arrears owing to the landlord for a total of **311 days** comprising the following: **9 days** (23 to 31 July 2013); **61 days** (1 September to 31 October 2013); and **241 days** (1 August 2014 to 29 March 2015).

#### Total amount of wasted capital expenses

114    Adding up these two components, the total sum allowed as damages under Category 4c for wasted capital expenses is **$151,384.18**.[^173]

115    However, the defendant submits that “the Plaintiffs had caused the breach of their own Lease” and “\[t\]he Defendants therefore ought not to be liable for the period of closure after September 2014 at worst.”[^174] In other words, the defendant submits that its liability in relation to the wasted capital expenses ought to be capped to the period ending September 2014.

116    As explained above at \[25\]–\[30\], the plaintiff’s failure to pay the rent timeously was but one of the two effective causes of the plaintiff’s breach of the Lease, with the defendant’s breach leading to the closure of the Suntec Clinic after the second flood being the other effective cause. For the defendant to be liable for the plaintiff’s loss, it suffices that the defendant’s breach was an effective cause of the repossession of the clinic. In this regard, given that the plaintiff could not resume business at the Suntec Clinic due to the defendant’s breach which caused the second flood, the defendant’s breach was clearly an effective cause of the clinic closures and eventual repossession of the clinic. This repossession caused the capital expenses spent to set up the Suntec Clinic to be wasted. It does not matter that the plaintiff’s failure to pay the rent in time also contributed to the clinic’s repossession by the landlord, as this factor does not override the consequences of the defendant’s breach (see \[30\] above), nor does it render the defendant’s breach an ineffective cause of the breach of the Lease. The defendant’s argument in this regard is accordingly rejected.

117    Therefore, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff for a total of **$151,384.18** under Category 4c for both the wasted depreciation expenses and the wasted rent for the period commencing from 6 March 2015 and ending on 21 September 2016.

### Category 4d:   Other damages in connection with the early termination of the Lease and repossession by the landlord on 30 March 2015

118    Turning to Category 4d, which relates to other damages incurred by the plaintiff in connection with the early termination of the Lease and repossession of the premises by the landlord on 30 March 2015, the plaintiff claims for (a) the security deposit in the sum of **$57,237.12** (being three months’ rent inclusive of GST) which was forfeited together with the GST as the plaintiff could not complete the Lease period of three years,[^175] and (b) legal fees in the sum of **$26,978.17** which the plaintiff bore in connection with the suit initiated by the landlord.[^176]

119    The defendant submits that the legal fees and forfeiture of the security deposit were caused by the plaintiff’s own repudiation of the Lease. As canvassed above at \[25\]–\[30\], the defendant’s breach was also an effective cause of the plaintiff’s repudiation. Further, the settlement agreement with the landlord was a necessary mitigatory step that was undertaken by the plaintiff (see \[32\]–\[34\] above). Accordingly, I allow the plaintiff’s claims under Category 4d for a total amount of **$84,215.29**.

## Defendant’s counterclaim

120    Finally, I have decided in the Liability Judgment at \[157\] that the defendant is entitled to set-off the sum of **$87,432.50**, being the sum that the plaintiff owes to the defendant for variation works and other works which remains unpaid for.

121    The plaintiff submits that this sum of $87,432.50 ought to be pro-rated, given that the plaintiff was only able to operate the Suntec Clinic for 209 days out of the 1096 days in the three-year Lease.[^177] I do not agree that there should be any pro-rating of this sum because I have to first treat the whole contract as having been fully performed by the defendant, and the plaintiff as having fully paid the defendant for the whole contract price. Thereafter, the _difference_ has to be ascertained by comparing the assumed position (when the contract is deemed to have been fully performed) with the actual position (when the contract has been breached by the defendant). The _difference_ will then represent the amount of damages that the defendant would be liable to pay the plaintiff. That is what I have essentially done in the course of this judgment.

## Conclusion

122    In conclusion, I allow judgment in the sum of **$621,621.69** to the plaintiff for the plaintiff’s claim. The sum of **$87,432.50** awarded to the defendant for its counterclaim in the Liability Judgment will be set off against the judgment sum allowed to the plaintiff.
